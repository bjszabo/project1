    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Barbara Szabo. I’m a 46 year old mother, wife, full time electrical designer,
      and part-time student. I am origninally from Chicago and have lived most of my life here.
      Though, I did live in Michigan for 10 years. My background is varied and life has taken me
      in unexpected directions. I have one child: my son, Raymond, is 21 years of age. Other
      interests/hobbies I have beyond career, family, and school are exercise, crotchet, knitting,
      needlepoint, and volunteer bible instruction.
    </p>
      <p>
      My design/engineering experience is varied. I have worked on projects for power plants,
      both nuclear and fossil fuel types, some renewable energy, substations, commercial and residential
      buildings, and constrols systems, to name a few. I have worked in many different programs
      such as AutoCad, Microstation, Visual lighting softare, among others. I thoroughly love what I
      do and constantly look for ways to learn and grow.

      Current Status
    </h2>
      <p>
      I have an AAS in CADD from ITT that I earned in 1994, and I am currently enrolled as a part-time
      student at ITT in the process of pursuing my BSEE. I have been working towards this for many
      years and have had to fit school around life and family. Many ask me why do I still seek to get
      my BSEE since I’ve been in my career for 26 years now and am well-established. There are a few
      reasons for this. The first and simplest answer is because I want to. It’s alwasy good to do
      something for yourself that enriches you, and this is that for me. Second, because I enjoy it… the
      learning as well as the work. I want to grow in my knowledge and abilities. Not to mention
      learning continues to help the brain function. Third, even though I am capable of perfoming,
      and do perform engineering tasks, I need the degree in order to have more opportunities available
      to me. Hence, for me, it comes down to desire, enjoyment,and career necessity.

      I started my career in 1994 as an entry level drafter and have since gained experience and worked
      my way up to my current position of Senior Electrical/Lighting Designer. I have worked at a few different
      companies where I gained a vairety of experience in electrical design and engineering. The early part of
      my career was mainly focused around electrical engineering/design for commertial buildings. The latter
      half has been focused on power plants, substations, and substation security. I currently work full-time
      for a local engineering firm. I have been there for just over ten years now and am currently a physical
      design lead for one of our substation security design teams.

      Regarding this class, it seemed like an interesting topic to learn about. I make it a goal to make
      sure even my electives have some sort of relevance in my life, be it personal or career.
      At my age, time and money are very precious, so I must make it worth the sacrifices. When I say
      sacrifices I’m talking about things such as time I could be spending on date nights with my
      husband, or going to shows with my friends, or just relaxing and getting the sleep I deserve
      at this point in my life. Since I’ve often wondered about the possibility of creating a blog or
      a site of some sort and wasn’t sure how to go about it, this seemed like a good place to start.
      I expect this class will give me a taste of that world and will also help me to see if it really
      is something I’d like to do or not. I look forward to learning these concepts and putting them into
      practice. Additionally, just as in all my classes, family life, and work life, I plan to work hard,
      do my best, and provide work that is high in quality and meets/exceeds expectations.

      My career ambitions are simple. I simply want to always grow and imporeve. I absolutely love my
      career. I feel blessed to love going to work and looking forward to my day (most of the time).
      However, there is so much out there yet for me to avail myself of but can’t unless/untill I become
      a degreed enginner. Additionally I plan to take the FE (fundamentals of engineering) and then the PE
      (professional engineering) exams in order to become a licensed engineer. Then I will be able to
      fully open myself up to all possible opportunities. I also enjoy being a lead and a mentor and
      that the more I learn and grow the more I’ll have to teach and share with others. Lastly, I hope to
      utilize what I learn in this class, and all my other classes, in whatever way possible as my
      career continues to progress. I expect that my 26+ years of practical experience being able to be
      combined with a BSEE degree, and PE license will go a long way in opening up new avenues for me.
