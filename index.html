    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Barbara Szabo. I’m a mother, wife, full time electrical designer, and part-time student. My background
      is varied and life has taken me in unexpected directions. As a young person I had dreams of studying at MSOE (Milwaulkee School of Engineering) to become and Architect. However,
      due to circumstances beyond my control, college was taken from my options at that time. So, instead I worked full-time at Walgreens until I could figure things out. I then enrolled in ITT
      (by then also working full time at both Walgreens and McDonald’s while attencing classes 20 hours a week) and earned and Associates in Computer Aided Drafting and Design. This led me
      into a career in the electrical world. I started as a drafter/CAD operator, and as I gained knowlege and experience I advanced in my career to where I am now, which is a Senior Electrical
      Designer. In the early 2000s I was encouraged by an engineer I worked under to go back to school for my BSEE. I’ve been working towards that goal since then. Part-time is a must for me,
      then because I had a family and a full-time career and now becasue I have a full-time career (my son is 21 and moved out).

    <h2>
      Current Ambitions
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many ask me why do I still seek to get my BSEE since I’ve been in my career for 26 years now and am well-established. There are a few reasons for this. The first and simplest answer is becaue
      I want to. It’s alwasy good to do something for yourself that enriches you, and this is for me. Second, because I enjoy it… the learning as well as the work, so I want to grow
      in my knowledge and abilities. Not to mention learning continues to help the brain function. Third, becuase the reality is that I need the piece of paper (the degree) in order to have more
      opportunities available to me. While I can do, and have done, and still do engineering work, the reality is I won’t be recognized as an engineer unless and untill I receive the degree.
      It doesn’t matter that I have more knowledge and experience than newly degreed persons. Nor does it matter that all engineering graduates have to have on the job training to truly learn
      and understand what they need to do at their job (school mainly teaches theory and problem solving, but the real practial and actual work a person will be doing won’t be learned until
      they actually go to work). Hence, for me, it comes down to desire, enjoyment,and career necessity.

      Regarding this class, it seemed like an interesting topic to learn about. I make it a goal to make sure even my electives have some sort of relevance in my life, be it personal or career.
      At my age time and money are very precious, so I must make it worth the sacrifices. When I say sacrifices I’m talking about things such as time I could be spending on date nights with my
      husband, or going to shows with my friends, or just relaxing and getting the sleep I deserve at this point in my life. Since I’ve often wondered about the possibly creating a blog or a site
      of some sort and wasn’t sure how to go about it, this seemed like a good place to start. I expect this class will give me a taste of that world and will also help me to see if it really
      is something I’d like to do or not. I look forward to learning these concepts. And, just as in all my classes, my family life, and work life, I plan to work hard and do my best and provide
      work that is high in quality and meets/exceeds expectations.

    <h2>
      Future Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      I absolutely love my career. I feel blessed to love going to work and looking forward to my day (most of the time). However, there is so much out there yet for me to avail myself of but can’t
      unless/untill I become a degreed enginner. Additionally I plan to take the FE (fundamentals of engineering) and then the PE (professional engineering)exams in order to become a licensed engineer
      so that I fully open myself up to all possible opportunities. I also enjoy being a lead and a mentor and that the more I learn and grow the more I’ll have to teach and share with others.
      Additionally, I hope to utilize what I learn in this class, and all my other classes, in whatever way possible as my career continues to progress. I expec that having my 26+ years of practical
      experience, combined with a BSEE degree, and PE license will go a long way in opening up new avenues for me.
