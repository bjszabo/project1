      <p>
        I’m a 46 year old mother, wife, full-time electrical designer, and part-time student.
        I am origninally from Chicago and have lived most of my life here. I have one child.
        My son, Raymond, is 21 years of age. When I’m not working or doing school work I enjoy spending time
        with my husband or working on my own hobbies (knitting, crotcheting, reading, exercising).
      </p>
      <p>
        I earned my AAS in CADD (Computer Aided Design and Drafting) from ITT in 1994, graduationg with
        “highest honors.” Currently, I am considered a junior at IIT, in pursuit of earning my BSEE.
        This has been something I have been working towards on a part-time basis for many years now.
        I expect to finally finish in about three years. Many ask me why do I still seek to get my
        BSEE since I’ve been in my career for 26 years now and am well-established. There are a few
        reasons for this. The first, and simplest answer, is because I want to. It’s alwasy good to
        do something for yourself that enriches you, and this is that for me. Second, because I
        enjoy it… the learning as well as the work. I want to grow in my knowledge and abilities.
        Not to mention learning continues to help the brain function. Third, even though I am capable
        of perfoming, and do perform engineering tasks, I need the degree in order to have more
        opportunities available to me. Hence, for me, it comes down to desire, enjoyment,and career necessity.

        I started my career in 1994 as an entry level drafter and have since gained experience and worked
        my way up to my current position of Senior Electrical/Lighting Designer. I have worked at a few different
        companies where I gained a variety of experience in electrical design and engineering. The early part of
        my career was mainly focused around electrical engineering/design for commercial buildings. The latter
        half has been focused on power plants, substations, and substation security. Except for a couple short
        years working with contols, most of my experience is in power distribution and lighting systems.
        I currently work full-time for a local engineering firm. I have been there for just over ten years
        and am currently a physical design lead for one of our substation security design teams. I have worked
        with many different programs such as AutoCad, Microstation, Visual lighting softare, among others. I
        thoroughly love what I do and constantly look for ways to learn and grow.

      Ambitions
    </h2>
      <p>
        Regarding this class, it seemed like an interesting topic to learn about. I make it a goal to make
        sure even my electives have some sort of relevance in my life, be it personal or career.
        At my age, time and money are very precious, so I must make it worth the sacrifices. When I say
        sacrifices, I’m talking about things such as time I could be spending on date nights with my
        husband, or going to shows with my friends, or just relaxing and getting the sleep I deserve
        at this point in my life. Since I’ve often wondered about the possibility of creating a blog or
        a site of some sort and wasn’t sure how to go about it, this seemed like a good place to start.
        I expect this class will give me a taste of that world and will also help me to see if it really
        is something I’d like to do. I look forward to learning these concepts and putting them into
        practice. Additionally, just as in all my classes, family life, and work life, I plan to work hard,
        do my best, and provide work that is high in quality and meets/exceeds expectations.
      </p>

        My career ambitions are simple: to continually learn, grow, and constantly seek new opportunities.
        There is so much out there yet for me to avail myself of but can’t unless/untill I become
        a degreed enginner. Additionally, I plan to take the FE (fundamentals of engineering) and then the PE
        (professional engineering) exams in order to become a licensed engineer. Then I will be able to
        fully open myself up to all possible opportunities. I also enjoy being a lead and a mentor and
        the more I learn and grow the more I’ll be able to teach and share with others. Lastly, I hope to
        utilize what I learn in this class, and all my other classes, in whatever way possible as my
        career continues to progress. I expect that my 26+ years of practical experience being able to be
        combined with a BSEE degree, and PE license will go a long way in opening up new avenues for me.
