    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Barbara Szabo. I’m a 46 year old mother, wife, full time electrical designer,
      and part-time student. I am origninally from Chicago and have lived most of my life here.
      Though, I did live in Michigan for 10 years. My background is varied and life has taken me
      in unexpected directions. I have one child: my son, Raymond, is 21 years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a young person I had dreams of studying at MSOE (Milwaulkee School of Engineering) to
      become and Architect. However, due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to do so.
      Eventually I was able to pursue and AAS detree in CADD from ITT, while at the same time working
      two full-time jobs. In 1994, just before graduating, I started my career in the electrical world.
      First as an entry-level drafter, and learning and working my way up to the Senior electrical
      Designer postion that I hold today. reer (my son is 21 and moved out).
    </p>
    <p>
      My design/engineering experience is varied. I have worked on projects for power plants,
      both nuclear and fossil fuel types, some renewable energy, substations, commercial and residential
      buildings, and constrols systems, to name a few. I have worked in many different programs
      such as AutoCad, Microstation, Visual lighting softare, among others. I thoroughly love what I
      do and constantly look for ways to learn and grow.
    <h2>
      Current Status
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am currently enrolled as a part-time student at ITT in the process of pursuing
      my BSEE. I have been working towards this for many years and have had to fit school
      around life and family. Many ask me why do I still seek to get my BSEE since I’ve been
      in my career for 26 years now and am well-established. There are a few reasons for this.
      The first and simplest answer is because I want to. It’s alwasy good to do something
      for yourself that enriches you, and this is that for me. Second, because I enjoy it… the
      learning as well as the work. I want to grow in my knowledge and abilities. Not to mention
      learning continues to help the brain function. Third, even though I am capable of perfoming,
      and do perform engineering tasks, I need the degree in order to have more opportunities available
      to me. Hence, for me, it comes down to desire, enjoyment,and career necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I work full-time for a local engineering firm. I have been there for just over
      ten years now. My focus had firsst been mainly nuclear and coal powered power plants. For the last
      couple years or so I've been more involved in substation and stubstation security design. My currently
      role is as a physical design lead for one of our security design teams.

      Ambitions

    <p>
      Regarding this class, it seemed like an interesting topic to learn about. I make it a goal to make
      sure even my electives have some sort of relevance in my life, be it personal or career.
      At my age, time and money are very precious, so I must make it worth the sacrifices. When I say
      sacrifices I’m talking about things such as time I could be spending on date nights with my
      husband, or going to shows with my friends, or just relaxing and getting the sleep I deserve
      at this point in my life. Since I’ve often wondered about the possibility of creating a blog or
      a site of some sort and wasn’t sure how to go about it, this seemed like a good place to start.
      I expect this class will give me a taste of that world and will also help me to see if it really
      is something I’d like to do or not. I look forward to learning these concepts and putting them into
      practice. Additionally, just as in all my classes, family life, and work life, I plan to work hard,
      do my best, and provide work that is high in quality and meets/exceeds expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      My career ambitions are simple. I simply want to always grow and imporeve. I absolutely love my
      career. I feel blessed to love going to work and looking forward to my day (most of the time).
      However, there is so much out there yet for me to avail myself of but can’t unless/untill I become
      a degreed enginner. Additionally I plan to take the FE (fundamentals of engineering) and then the PE
      (professional engineering) exams in order to become a licensed engineer. Then I will be able to
      fully open myself up to all possible opportunities. I also enjoy being a lead and a mentor and
      that the more I learn and grow the more I’ll have to teach and share with others. Lastly, I hope to
      utilize what I learn in this class, and all my other classes, in whatever way possible as my
      career continues to progress. I expect that my 26+ years of practical experience being able to be
      combined with a BSEE degree, and PE license will go a long way in opening up new avenues for me.
